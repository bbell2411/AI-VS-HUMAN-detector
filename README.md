## üéØ Project Overview

TextGuardAPI is a production-ready REST API that provides real-time text classification services through a robust, scalable backend architecture. Built with FastAPI and deployed using modern DevOps practices, this project demonstrates full-stack engineering capabilities by integrating machine learning models into a high-performance web service.

The API processes text submissions through an optimized ML pipeline, stores predictions in a PostgreSQL database, and provides comprehensive analytics - all while maintaining sub-100ms response times. The entire system is containerized with Docker and deployed to cloud infrastructure with automated CI/CD.
